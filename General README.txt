This repository contains tools for the analysis of juvenile pyroclasts for fragmentation studies in Volcanology. The tools are primarily designed to prepare and process SEM-BSE images of particle cross-sections, but the use could be extended to other types of images.

The repository consist of three folders:

1) Image Preparation_Photoshop - A semi-automated image preparation “action pack” in Adobe Photoshop (CC 19.0 release), that allows batch processing of a stack of SEM-BSE images of juvenile particle cross-sections.
2) Image Processing_PASTA - The PASTA script for Fiji (ImageJ), which allows the automated isolation of single particles, the semi-automated processing and measurements of shape parameters, 2D crystallinity and 2D vesicularity.
3) Windows_TEMPLATE_Folders - Template folders for image preparation and processing for Microsoft Windows® operative systems.

Both procedures come with detailed user guides.
