This repository contains the full protocol for the analysis of juvenile pyroclasts for fragmentation studies in Volcanology.

The repository consist of two parts:

1) A semi-automated image preparation in Adobe Photoshop (CC 19.0 release), featuring a step-by-step user guide and a pre-set action pack that allow batch processing of a stack of BSE-SEM images of juvenile pyroclasts embedded in epoxy resin, either a polished grain mount or thin section
2) A Fiji (ImageJ) script for the automated isolation of single particles, the semiautomated processing and measurements of shape parameters, 2-D crystallinity and 2-D vesicularity. A related step-by-step guide provide details of each step
