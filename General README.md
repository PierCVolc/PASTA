This repository contains tools for the analysis of juvenile pyroclasts for fragmentation studies in Volcanology. The tools are primarily designed to prepare and process SEM images of particle cross-sections, but the use could be extended to other types of images.

The repository consist of two parts:

1) A semi-automated image preparation “action pack” in Adobe Photoshop (CC 19.0 release), that allows batch processing of a stack of BSE-SEM images of juvenile pyroclasts embedded in epoxy resin.
2) A Fiji (ImageJ) script for the automated isolation of single particles, the semi-automated processing and measurements of shape parameters, 2-D crystallinity and 2-D vesicularity.

Note: detailed user guides will be published in the future.
